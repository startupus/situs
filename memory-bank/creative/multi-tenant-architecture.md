📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Multi-Tenant Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design multi-tenant architecture for Situs platform
Requirements:

- Data isolation between tenants
- Support for 1000+ tenants
- 99.9% uptime per tenant
- Horizontal scaling capability
- GDPR compliance
- Performance: <100ms response times
  Constraints:
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Existing NestJS architecture
- Event Bus integration required
- Plugin System compatibility

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Database per Tenant - Separate database for each tenant
Option B: Shared Database with Row-Level Security - Single database with tenant isolation
Option C: Hybrid Approach - Shared database with tenant-specific schemas

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | DB per Tenant | Shared DB + RLS | Hybrid Approach |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Data Isolation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Maintenance | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Cost | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Database per tenant offers best isolation but poor scalability
- Shared database with RLS provides good balance but complex setup
- Hybrid approach offers flexibility but highest complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option B: Shared Database with Row-Level Security
Rationale: Best balance of isolation, scalability, and maintainability for 1000+ tenants

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Implement PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Add tenant_id to all tables with proper indexing
- Use tenant context middleware for automatic filtering
- Implement tenant-aware connection pooling
- Add tenant-specific caching strategy
