📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Types System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design type-safe event system with comprehensive event definitions
Requirements:

- Strong TypeScript typing for all events
- Event versioning and backward compatibility
- Event schema validation
- Auto-generated documentation
- IDE autocomplete support
- Runtime type checking
  Constraints:
- Must support existing 20+ event types
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Support for event evolution
- Integration with Prisma schema

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Enum-based Types - Simple enum with string literals
Option B: Class-based Events - Event classes with validation
Option C: Schema-driven Types - JSON Schema with code generation

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Enum-based | Class-based | Schema-driven |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Type Safety | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Runtime Validation | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Documentation | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| IDE Support | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Versioning | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Enum-based approach is simple but lacks runtime validation
- Class-based events provide good type safety and validation
- Schema-driven approach offers best documentation and versioning

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Schema-driven Types with Class Validation
Rationale: Best combination of type safety, documentation, and maintainability

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Use JSON Schema for event definitions
- Generate TypeScript types from schemas
- Implement runtime validation with class-validator
- Add event versioning through schema evolution
- Generate API documentation from schemas
- Support for event inheritance and composition
