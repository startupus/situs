📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: TypeScript Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design comprehensive TypeScript architecture for Situs platform
Requirements:

- 100% type coverage for all code
- Elimination of all 'any' types
- Runtime type validation
- Performance optimization
- Developer experience enhancement
  Constraints:
- Existing React + NestJS codebase
- Prisma ORM integration
- Event Bus and Plugin System compatibility
- Multi-tenant system integration

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Strict TypeScript - Maximum type safety with strict settings
Option B: Gradual TypeScript - Progressive typing with relaxed settings
Option C: Hybrid TypeScript - Strict core with flexible boundaries

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Strict | Gradual | Hybrid |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Type Safety | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Developer Experience | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Migration Effort | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Maintainability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Runtime Safety | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Strict TypeScript provides maximum safety but poor DX during migration
- Gradual approach offers best migration path but limited safety
- Hybrid approach balances safety with practical migration

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Hybrid TypeScript with Progressive Strictness
Rationale: Balance between type safety and practical migration while maintaining performance

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Start with relaxed settings for existing code
- Gradually increase strictness for new code
- Implement runtime type validation for critical paths
- Use type-only imports for performance
- Add comprehensive type documentation
