📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Middleware System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design middleware system for event processing pipeline
Requirements:

- Pluggable event processing pipeline
- Event validation and transformation
- Security and access control
- Logging and monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance: <10ms middleware overhead
  Constraints:
- Must work with existing NestJS architecture
- Support for async middleware
- Type-safe middleware registration
- Graceful error handling without breaking event flow

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Simple Chain Pattern - Linear middleware chain
Option B: Pipeline Pattern - Configurable processing pipeline
Option C: Plugin-based Middleware - Dynamic middleware registration

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Chain | Pipeline | Plugin-based |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Flexibility | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Type Safety | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Debugging | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Configuration | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Error Handling | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Chain pattern offers best performance but limited flexibility
- Pipeline pattern provides good balance of performance and configurability
- Plugin-based approach offers maximum flexibility but adds complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option B: Pipeline Pattern with Conditional Middleware
Rationale: Optimal balance of performance, flexibility, and maintainability

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Implement configurable middleware pipeline
- Support conditional middleware execution based on event type
- Add middleware ordering and dependency management
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing middleware
- Add comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- Support middleware hot-reloading in development
