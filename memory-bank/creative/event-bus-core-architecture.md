📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Bus Core Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design the core Event Bus architecture for Situs platform
Requirements:

- Centralized event system with TypeScript support
- Integration with existing SSE infrastructure
- Multi-tenant event isolation
- Async event processing with guaranteed delivery
- Plugin system compatibility
- Performance: 100+ events/sec, <100ms latency
  Constraints:
- Must maintain backward compatibility with RealtimeEventsService
- PostgreSQL as event store
- NestJS module architecture
- Cross-browser SSE compatibility

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Enhanced RealtimeEventsService - Extend existing RxJS-based system
Option B: New EventBus with Adapter Pattern - Wrapper around existing system
Option C: Complete Event Bus Replacement - Full rewrite with modern architecture

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Enhanced RxJS | Adapter Pattern | Complete Rewrite |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Development Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Backward Compatibility | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Maintainability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Risk Level | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Enhanced RxJS offers fastest implementation but limited scalability
- Adapter Pattern provides good balance of compatibility and performance
- Complete rewrite offers best long-term solution but highest risk

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option B: New EventBus with Adapter Pattern
Rationale: Optimal balance of development speed, compatibility, and future scalability

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Create EventBusService as wrapper around RealtimeEventsService
- Implement Event Store with PostgreSQL for persistence
- Add middleware system for event processing pipeline
- Maintain existing SSE endpoints during transition
- Implement gradual migration strategy
