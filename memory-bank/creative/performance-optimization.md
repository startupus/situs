📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Performance Optimization Strategy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design performance optimization strategy for multi-tenant TypeScript system
Requirements:

- Fast TypeScript compilation (<30s)
- Optimized type checking performance
- Efficient tenant resolution (<10ms)
- Scalable database queries
- Memory usage optimization
  Constraints:
- 1000+ tenants support
- Complex type system
- Real-time event processing
- Plugin system overhead

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Compilation Optimization - Focus on TypeScript build performance
Option B: Runtime Optimization - Optimize runtime performance
Option C: Hybrid Optimization - Combine compilation and runtime optimization
Option D: Progressive Optimization - Gradual optimization with monitoring

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Compilation | Runtime | Hybrid | Progressive |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Build Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Runtime Performance | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Development Experience | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Maintenance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Monitoring | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Risk Management | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Compilation optimization improves developer experience
- Runtime optimization improves user experience
- Hybrid approach provides comprehensive optimization
- Progressive optimization minimizes risks

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Hybrid Optimization with Progressive Implementation
Rationale: Comprehensive optimization with risk management and monitoring

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Implement incremental TypeScript compilation
- Add tenant-aware caching strategies
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use type-only imports for performance
- Implement performance monitoring and alerting
