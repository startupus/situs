📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Bus Performance Optimization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design performance optimization strategies for Event Bus
Requirements:

- Handle 100+ events per second
- Maintain <100ms event delivery latency
- Support 100+ concurrent SSE connections
- Efficient memory usage (<500MB)
- Database query optimization (<50ms)
- Horizontal scaling capability
  Constraints:
- PostgreSQL as event store
- Single server deployment initially
- Limited memory and CPU resources
- Network bandwidth considerations

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Synchronous Processing - Process events immediately
Option B: Async Queue Processing - Queue events for batch processing
Option C: Hybrid Processing - Critical events sync, others async

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Synchronous | Async Queue | Hybrid |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Latency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Throughput | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Memory Usage | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Reliability | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Synchronous processing offers lowest latency but limited throughput
- Async queue provides best throughput and reliability
- Hybrid approach balances latency and throughput requirements

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Hybrid Processing with Smart Routing
Rationale: Optimal balance of latency, throughput, and resource utilization

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Process critical events (user actions) synchronously
- Queue non-critical events (logs, metrics) for batch processing
- Implement event priority system for routing decisions
- Use connection pooling for database operations
- Add event batching for SSE delivery
- Implement circuit breakers for failing components
