📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Bus Monitoring System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design comprehensive monitoring system for Event Bus
Requirements:

- Real-time performance metrics
- Event delivery success rates
- Error tracking and alerting
- Health check endpoints
- Dashboard for operational visibility
- Integration with existing health-monitor.js
  Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Minimal performance impact on event processing
- Support for both development and production environments
- Cost-effective monitoring solution

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Custom Metrics System - Build monitoring from scratch
Option B: Prometheus Integration - Use Prometheus for metrics collection
Option C: Hybrid Monitoring - Custom metrics + external tools

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Custom | Prometheus | Hybrid |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Development Time | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Feature Richness | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance Impact | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Maintenance | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Integration | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Cost | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Custom system offers full control but limited features
- Prometheus provides rich monitoring capabilities
- Hybrid approach balances features with existing infrastructure

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Hybrid Monitoring with Enhanced health-monitor.js
Rationale: Leverages existing infrastructure while adding comprehensive Event Bus monitoring

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Extend existing health-monitor.js with Event Bus metrics
- Add custom metrics for event throughput, latency, and errors
- Implement health check endpoints for Event Bus components
- Create operational dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Add alerting for critical Event Bus failures
- Integrate with existing logging and error tracking
