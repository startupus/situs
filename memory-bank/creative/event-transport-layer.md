📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Transport Layer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design transport layer for event delivery to clients
Requirements:

- Real-time delivery via SSE
- Webhook support for external systems
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Fallback mechanisms for connection issues
- Multi-tenant event filtering
- Performance: <100ms delivery latency
  Constraints:
- Must maintain existing SSE endpoints
- Support for 100+ concurrent connections
- Browser compatibility (IE11+, modern browsers)
- Network resilience and reconnection

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: SSE-Only Transport - Server-Sent Events for all delivery
Option B: Hybrid Transport - SSE + WebSockets + Webhooks
Option C: Universal Transport - SSE + Webhooks + Polling fallback

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | SSE-Only | Hybrid | Universal |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Browser Support | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Real-time Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Implementation Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Network Resilience | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| External Integration | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Resource Usage | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- SSE-only provides good real-time performance but limited external integration
- Hybrid approach offers best performance but higher complexity
- Universal transport ensures maximum compatibility and resilience

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Universal Transport with Smart Fallback
Rationale: Ensures maximum compatibility and reliability for production use

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Primary: SSE for real-time delivery with automatic reconnection
- Secondary: Webhooks for external system integration
- Fallback: Polling mechanism for problematic connections
- Implement connection health monitoring
- Add exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Use EventSource polyfill for older browsers
