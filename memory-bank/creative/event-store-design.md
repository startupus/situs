📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Store Design
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design persistent event storage system for Event Bus
Requirements:

- Store all events with full metadata
- Support event querying and filtering
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Event replay capabilities
- Performance: 1000+ events/sec write, <50ms query
- Data retention and archiving
  Constraints:
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Must integrate with existing Prisma schema
- Support for event versioning
- GDPR compliance for user events

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Single Events Table - All events in one table with type column
Option B: Partitioned Tables - Separate tables per event type
Option C: Event Sourcing Pattern - Full event sourcing with snapshots

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Single Table | Partitioned | Event Sourcing |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Query Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Write Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Storage Efficiency | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Implementation Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Multi-tenant Support | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Event Replay | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Single table simplest to implement but may have performance issues at scale
- Partitioned tables offer best query performance for specific event types
- Event sourcing provides full audit trail but adds complexity

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option A: Single Events Table with Smart Indexing
Rationale: Best balance of simplicity and performance for current scale requirements

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Use single `events` table with JSON payload column
- Implement composite indexes on (projectId, type, timestamp)
- Add separate indexes for tenantId and userId
- Use PostgreSQL JSON operators for payload querying
- Implement table partitioning by date for archiving
- Add event versioning through metadata field
