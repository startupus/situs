📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Event Bus Integration Strategy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design integration strategy with existing RealtimeEventsService
Requirements:

- Zero-downtime migration
- Backward compatibility with existing SSE clients
- Gradual feature rollout
- Rollback capability
- Performance monitoring during transition
- Minimal code changes in existing modules
  Constraints:
- Cannot break existing functionality
- Must support current React hooks
- Limited development time for migration
- Production system stability

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Big Bang Migration - Complete replacement in single deployment
Option B: Strangler Fig Pattern - Gradual replacement with feature flags
Option C: Adapter Bridge Pattern - Event Bus as adapter around existing system

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Big Bang | Strangler Fig | Adapter Bridge |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Risk Level | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Development Time | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Rollback Ease | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Testing Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance Impact | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Feature Parity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Big Bang offers fastest delivery but highest risk
- Strangler Fig provides safe migration but longer timeline
- Adapter Bridge offers lowest risk with immediate benefits

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option C: Adapter Bridge Pattern with Gradual Enhancement
Rationale: Lowest risk approach with immediate value and future flexibility

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Implement EventBusService as adapter around RealtimeEventsService
- Add new features incrementally without breaking existing functionality
- Use feature flags for new Event Bus capabilities
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Create migration scripts for gradual component migration
- Maintain parallel systems during transition period
