📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Type System Organization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
Description: Design type system organization for comprehensive TypeScript architecture
Requirements:

- Centralized type definitions
- Modular type organization
- Type reusability and inheritance
- Performance optimization
- Developer experience
  Constraints:
- Multi-tenant system types
- Event Bus and Plugin System types
- React component types
- API and database types

2️⃣ OPTIONS
Option A: Flat Type Structure - All types in single directory
Option B: Domain-Based Organization - Types organized by business domain
Option C: Layer-Based Organization - Types organized by architectural layer
Option D: Hybrid Organization - Combination of domain and layer organization

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
| Criterion | Flat | Domain-Based | Layer-Based | Hybrid |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Maintainability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Discoverability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Reusability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Scalability | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Team Collaboration | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

Key Insights:

- Flat structure is simple but doesn't scale
- Domain-based organization aligns with business logic
- Layer-based organization follows technical architecture
- Hybrid approach provides best of both worlds

4️⃣ DECISION
Selected: Option D: Hybrid Organization with Domain-First Structure
Rationale: Best balance of maintainability, discoverability, and team collaboration

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Organize by domain (users, tenants, events, plugins)
- Sub-organize by layer (api, database, ui, shared)
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Implement type inheritance and composition
- Add type documentation and examples
